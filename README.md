# Service: Pokémon Height/Weight Analyzer
## About
This project is the response to a technical challenge by StratusGrid. I will be attempting to satisfy all requirements for this challenge to the best of my abilities. 

## Technologies

- Node.js
- Javascript
- Axios

## Requirements & Specifications

- Take two CLI inputs: limit and offset
- Query a list of Pokémon from the API using the limit and offset inputs mentioned above
- Query details for each Pokémon to retrieve it’s height and weight
- Calculate an average weight and height for all the Pokémon in the subset queried
- Print the average calculation results to the terminal
- Track the time it takes in seconds to execute the entire service and print to terminal following the averages
- Add at least one unit test case to the project using a unit testing framework of your choice
